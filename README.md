# Welcome to RMF's _Classic Mathematical Literature_ Library

All are invited to use, enjoy, and help build this collection of
[Proofscape](https://proofscape.org) modules diagramming theorems
and proofs from classic mathematical literature.

The project is organized by
[Royalroad Mathematics Foundation](https://royalroadmath.org) (RMF).


## What's in the library?

The vision is that the library should encompass works by mathematicians
like those apt to be listed under the [MacTutor](https://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/)
biographies. It should cover classic works of historical significance.

In terms of Proofscape concepts, the modules in this library contain
_only deductions_ (no annotations or examplorers). These deductions
represent only theorems and proofs _from the literature_ (no expansions).


## What about everything else?

As mentioned above, this library is meant to represent only the deductions
that are actually present in the literature. So what about everything else you
can do in Proofscape, like expansions, annotations, and examplorers?

The answer is that it's up to you. Studying mathematics? Why not start
your own Proofscape repo in which to record (and share) your notes?
Feeling more ambitious? Why not develop your own interactive textbook?

If you need some help getting started, take a look at
[Steve's notes](https://github.com/skieffer/mathnotes) for some examples
of what you can do.


## How do I contribute?

Contributing is easy. Fork this repository, add or improve some modules,
and make a pull request.

The easiest way to develop Proofscape modules is by downloading
and running the Proofscape Server locally. (Instructions coming soon!)
