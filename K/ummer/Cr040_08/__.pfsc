        1. While we have stayed true to Kummer's way of defining $@alp$ (see e.g. Cr035_16),

        \"complex numbers formed from $@lam eth$ roots of unity\".

        Instead, toward the end of the proof of Case 1, he begins to say,
        \"with the exception of the one case $@lam = 3$,\" as soon as it becomes
        necessary to do so. At the end of his proof of Case 1 he refers to this
        case as one \"which we will not consider here.\"
